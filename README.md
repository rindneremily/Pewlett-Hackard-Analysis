# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Analysis
This analysis of the tables was designed to sift through large pieces of data and find relevant information to support what the customer needs. By comparing the datasets, we could analyze the eligibility of each employee for retirement and mentorship. It also gives the company more information about how long each employee is expected to continue working. This gives them insight into the future and they can better plan for their company.
## Results
* After completing this challenge, the large number of employees retiring at once can be concerning as an employer. Though there is another generation of employees starting to work, the company will be losing their senior employees very quickly.
* There are quite a few people eligible to be mentors but I think it is important to take that number lightly. Even if they are elibigle, there is no guarantee that all of them will want to be mentors. I think that it is safer to rely on 50% of them becoming mentors for new employees rather than relying on all of them.
*There is a correlation between age and title in the company. There is data leaning towards older employees having senior status.

## Summary
Several roles will have to be filled. The "silver tsunami" will likely affect the employees' abilities to work. With weather conditions worsening, it's unlikely that employees will be able to allocate the same amount of time to their work as before. Their performance would be affected and they would have to take time off. Taking this time off will mean their role needs to be filled.
Having enough mentors highly depends on how many mentors the company wants to designate in their program. They have enough for a smaller generation of employees but it depends on how many people are in the next generation.
